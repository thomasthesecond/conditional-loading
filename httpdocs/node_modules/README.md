You'll need to install dependencies before you can run Grunt. This has not been done already because this ensures the most recent versions of the plugins are being used.

In terminal, `cd` to your site's **httpdocs** folder and run the following command:

	npm install grunt grunt-contrib-cssmin grunt-contrib-sass grunt-contrib-uglify grunt-contrib-watch grunt-cssc matchdep grunt-imageoptim grunt-contrib-requirejs grunt-replace --save-dev

The above command will get you up and running with all of the dependencies referenced in the **Gruntfile.js**. These dependencies are considered standard and should exist on every site. Feel free to add additional plugins as needed.

To install a plugin, run `npm install <plugin-name> --save-dev`.

To remove a plugin, run `npm remove <plugin-name> --save-dev`.

_Note:_ adding the `--save-dev` flag will automatically update your **package.json** file with the dependency.
